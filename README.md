# JavaProject
To run the project first we will have to download eclipse.

Then clone or download this repository. Downloaded reposity sould be saved in the root directory of eclipse.

Import and open the project in eclipse.

In eclipse go to the src folder where all the codes are located (path for the src folder is, "JavaProject-master\JavaProject\src") and open all the java files.

Before running the code you will have to change the original path of the images in the code to the path you have for the image files. Image files are located in the Image folder. You can copy the paths from there.

Changing the path:

On line 26 of FirstPanel.java file, instead of path "C:/Users/maisha/Downloads/JAVA/JavaProject-master/JavaProject/Images/carrot.png" , which is the original path of the image, you will have to put the path that you have for the carrot.png image in your computer. When you will copy and paste your path to the code, instead of one back slash (/) you might see two forward slashes(\\). You will have to change that to back slash.

Then do the same for SecondPanel.java, PersonImage.java, WallImage.java and Carrot.java

Run the code and play the game.
